# Using the GitHub Repository

To get started based on this repository, you need to get a copy locally. You have three options: fork, clone, or download. Most of the time, you probably just want to download.

You should **download the repository**, unblock the zip file, and extract it to a new folder if you just want to play with the project or you wish to use it as the starting point for an application.

You should **fork this repository** only if you plan on submitting a pull request. Or if you'd like to keep a copy of a snapshot of the repository in your own GitHub account.

You should **clone this repository** if you're one of the contributors and you have commit access to it. Otherwise you probably want one of the other options.
 
# Test Driven Development

### What is TDD?

> Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development
which combines test-first development, where you write a test before you write
just enough production code to fulfil that test, and refactoring. In other words,
itâ€™s one way to think through your requirements
or design before you write your functional code.

## How?

The *first* thing you need to *understand*
is that writing code following TDD (*discipline*)
is a (*slightly*) different approach from simply
diving into solving the problem (*without a test*).

When reading about TDD you will usually see the expression:
"***Red, Green, Refactor***":

![TDD Cycle: Red, Green, Refactor](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/6k9ojiN7VEFUUNKroUU62gZVf2pzzPnC5IbV)

What this means is that TDD follows a **3-step process**:

1. ***Write a Failing Test*** - Understand the (user)
requirements/story well enough to write a test for what you expect.
(_the test should **fail** initially - hence it being "Red"_)

2. ***Make the (failing) Test Pass*** - Write (*only*) the code you need
to make the (*failing*) test pass, while ensuring your existing/previous tests
all still pass (*no regressions*).

3. ***Refactor the code you wrote*** - Take the time to tidy up the code
*you* wrote to make it simpler
(*for your future self or colleagues to understand*)
before you need to ship the current feature.
